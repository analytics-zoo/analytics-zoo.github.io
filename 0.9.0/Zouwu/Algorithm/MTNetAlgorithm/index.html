<p>As we have mentioned before, MTNet is a memory-network based solution for multivariate time-series forecasting. The input data has a form of time series signal with several variables observed in each time stamp. Input data is divided into two parts, long-term historical data <strong>{X_i}</strong> and a short-term data series <strong>Q</strong>. Long-term historical data typically has several data series and each of them has the same length of the short-term data series.</p>
<p>One of the main modules of MTNet is its Encoder. It composes of three parts, a convolutional layer, an attention layer and a recurrent layer. For the convolutional layer, we have <code>cnn_hid_size</code> filters with width as the number of input feature <code>feature_dim</code> and height as <code>cnn_height</code>.  Then the convolution output is sent to a recurrent neural network with attention mechanism. You can have several RNN layers and the units number is set in <code>rnn_hid_size</code> The recurrent neural network is implemented as a GRU in this case.</p>

<p>As we have mentioned before, MTNet has two input, long-term historical data <strong>{X_i}</strong> and a short-term data series <strong>Q</strong>. The length of each long-term historical data series and the short-term data series is <code>series_length</code> and there are <code>long_series_num</code>  long-term historical data series in all (typically 7 as shown in this flow chart). Each <strong>X_i</strong> in <strong>{X_i}</strong> is encoded by the encoder to get <code>long_series_num</code> input memory representations <strong>{m_i}</strong>. Short-term data series is encoded by the encoder to get a query vector <strong>u</strong>.  By inner product between each <strong>m_i</strong> in <strong>{m_i}</strong> with <strong>u</strong> and a SoftMax operation, we get an attention weight distribution vector. The attention weight distribution vector is then element-wise multiplied by another encoded  representation <strong>{c_i}</strong> and get a weighted output <strong>{o_i}</strong>. The weighted output is concatenated with the query vector <strong>u</strong> and sent through a fully connected layer with output dimension as <code>target_dim</code>.</p>

<p>There is another auxiliary autoregressive model works independently. The autoregressive model assumes that the value to be forecasted is relevant to its previous value. <code>ar_window_size</code> states the number of previous value you want to use in the regression. The output feature number is also <code>target_dim</code>.</p>
<p>At last, the autoregressive model result is added with the memory network result to get the final time series prediction.</p>
